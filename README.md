# Repository for the GraphQL API component of SoCaTel platform.

This repository contains two components:
- a first component exposes a GraphQL API allowing access to social data (Twitter posts, Facebook posts, ...).
- a second component is in charge of translating the GraphQL requests into SparQL requests and performs these requests
on a GraphDB triple store instance.
